# Stability

In order to evaluate the stability we have done 48 experiments without delay.

This experiment was repated twice on `D1`.

The variation for RGB is less than 0.1%.

The experiment was redone using a delay of 600s between them. The main variation is probably due to temperature changes.We observe that the changes now can reach up to 0.5% and is very related to the color.
