# Patent blue V

To begin we did a very simple experiment that allows to measure the
absorbance of solutions containing different known concentrations of
patent blue V (E131), a blue pigment that is used in various blue
candies.

The result is rather good knowing that the solutions were simply prepared by
adding various volumes (0 to 2 mL) of a concentrated solution with a 1mL seringe to 100mL of water. Not the more accurate method...

# Detection of mercury water pollution using carbon quantum dots

In order to detect mercury, carbon quatum dots (CQDs) can be used. They are small particles of carbon (which can be homemade) that become fluorescent in presence of UV light.
The interesting part of this application is that the CQDs react differently with mercury, and that this difference can be measured using the simple-spectrophotometer.

## How to make CQDs ?

### Materials

– 14g of sucrose or fructose

– 40ml of lemon juice or 40 ml of water and 20 drops of HCl 18%

– 0.5 g of sodium bicarbonate

### Procedure 

1. Mix the sucrose/ fructose with your chosen acidic solution (we used an erlenmeyer).
2. Heat your solution up to 250°C for 40 minutes until it becomes black. Be careful to cover and agitate your solution.
3. Pour the content in a beaker and add in two times the sodium bicarbonate (your mix will inflate).
4. If the mixture is too thick, don't esitate to add up to 10ml of water.
5. Let cool down the solution of CQDs.

To use the CQDs, you will have to dilute them (for more precise quantities, please wait, work in progress...!)
