The goal is to create a simple spectrophotometer that measure the
absorbance of a sample at 3 different colors (red, green, blue), is
autonomous (on battery) and display the result on a screen.

The initial idea was that you could teach spectrophotometry without
having to buy an expensive instrument because you can find experiments
that does not require a single wavelength. This could included
optical density for bacteria culture, determination of a pigment in
a solution, determination of the kinetic of a reaction.

The device is rather cheap if you buy all the component on aliexpress 
(but one) and hav eaccess to a 3D printer. By constructing 10 the price
per spectrophotometer is around $25.

## Can we do science with this ?

Before trying to explain how it is done more in detail maybe the first
question that we should answer is : can we do science with this ? When 
thinking about the design of the spectro we found an electronic
component that converts the light energy to frequency and that is linear
on a range of nearly 10^6. This look really promising that we could
do something that gives good results.

To begin we did a very simple experiment that allows to measure the 
absorbance of solutions containing different known concentration of
pattent blue V (E131). A blue pigment that is used in various bleu
candies.

The result is rather good knowing that the solutions were simply prepared by
adding with a 1mL seringe various volume (0 to 2 mL) of a concentrated solution
to 100mL of water. Not the more accurate method.
