# Soldering the board

The PCB comes presolder with all the surface mounted components.

All the through hole component has however to be soldered by hand.

Please take care about the face on which you need to solder the components !!!!

The goal is to reach this final result:

## Bottom face

On this face we need to solder:
* Blue LED
* RGB common cathode LED
* TSL237 light to freuqency converter
* Socket for battery
* 10k potentiometer for LCD constrast control

### LEDs and TSL237

Please take care of the orientation of the components !
For the LEDs there is a flat side that shold be oriented as picture on the board.
For the light sensor (TSL237) the protrusion should points towards the RGB LED.

## Upper face 

The LCD is solder to the board using a single row straight strip pin header. Is is easier to first solder the LCD screen using the smaller part of the pins.
