## The case

The case is done using FreeCAD and OpenSCAD. This software looks rather complex at first but has the huge advantage that all the parameters may be set in an internal spreadsheet. This allows to design parametric boxes that can be easily changed and updated.

Currently we have 3 vesions of the box:
* the open-box can be easily opened to understand the way it works
* a box that is designed to be cut using a laser cutter in 3mm wood or plastic.
* the closed-box is designed to be screwed and possibly done by milling aluminium.


## Assembling the closed box

In order to prevent the battery to move it is fixed with Velcro<sup>Â®</sup> but to give the possibility to remove it we leave a peace of plastic under.

The PCB is fixed using brass standoff spacer (16mm - 10mm M3)

A foam of 3mm is placed in order to prevent the potentiometer to touch the battery and damage it. This was observed under heavy shaking in an incubator.

Finally the bottom is fixed to the top using 4 x M3 screws of 12mm.
