# How to use the spectro-plongeur ?

The spectro-plongeur can be used in the same way as the simple-spectro; refer to https://github.com/Hackuarium/simple-spectro/tree/master/docs/5-use. 

## Further development: automatic mode

The objective would be to control the spectro-plongeur from a RaspberryPI to enable automatic measurement of absorbance in the bioreactor https://github.com/Bioreactor/Bioreactor_v4.
