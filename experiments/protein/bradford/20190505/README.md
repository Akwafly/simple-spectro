## Trying Bradford test `from scratch`

The previous experiments using the commercial products where not that convincing and we are not sure about the reason.

We therefore decided to repeat the original experiment using commercially available products:
* BSA (5g on ebay)
* Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 CI42665 Acid Blue 90 (5g on ebay)

And based on the original publication from [Marion M. Bardford](https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-2697(76)90527-3)

The current version of the spectrophotometer only allows 3mL cuvette and from the protocol we will therefore use the _Protein assay (standard method)_.

For the standard protocol we need:
* 10 to 100Âµg of protein in 0.1 mL (NaCl 0.15M) (0.1g to 1g per liter)
* 5mL protein reagent

### Protein solutions

We prepare 10mL of BSA solution: 10mg in 0.15NaCl (1g/L)

### Bradfort reagent

* 100 mg of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 in 50mL ethanol 95%
* 100 mL 85% (w/v) phosphoric acid
* complete to 1L

### Experiments

Solutions:
* A: BSA 1g/L (in NaCl 0.15M solution)
* B: NaCl 0.15M
* C: Bradfort reagent
