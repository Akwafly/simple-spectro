# Escherichia coli

Another feature of the simple-spectrophotometer is that it works on a 
rechargeable battery (autonomy of 48 hours). Consequently, you can measure a kinetic
even by placing the device directly inside an incubator.

Optical density (OD) at 600nm is often used in biology to determine
biomass increase versus time. In this experiment we have placed 
Escherichia coli with cell growing media directly in the spectrophotometer
cuvette and placed the spectrophotometer itself on a shaker in the incubator.
We can then program it to measure the abosrbance every X seconds. In our case
we did every 30 minutes (up to 40 measures). The following curve was obtained.

This experiment clearly shows the log phase and the stationary phase. But
the growth was faster than expected ... An acquisition every 15 minutes
would have been a better choice.

# Rhizobium and bioluminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri

We tried to measure the growth of other bacteria, such as Rhizobium and Vibrio fischeri. We placed the simple-spectrophotometer on a shaker (inclined), at room temperature.

- For rhizobium, we took a measure every 15 minutes, during 12 hours. The bacteria grow at room temperature. For the blank we used only media. Then we inoculated the media and started to take measures. At the end, we obtained the following graph:

- For Vibrio fischeri, we took a measure every 15 minutes, during 14 hours and 30 minutes. The bacteria grow at room temperature. For the blank we used only media. Then we inoculated the media and started to take measures. At the end, we obtained the following graph:
