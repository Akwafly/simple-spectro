# Stability

In order to evaluate the stability we have done 48 experiments without delay.

This experiment was repeated twice on `D1`.

The variation for RGB is less than 0.1%.

The experiment was redone using a delay of 600s between them. The main variation is probably due to temperature changes.We observe that the changes now can reach up to 0.5% and is very related to the color.

In order to confirm the temperature importance this experiment was redone by acquiring as well the temperature.

We can clearly see a inverted correlation between the red variation and the temperature.

When repeating the same experiment blank (no sample) / sample (no sample) + blank / sample, etc.

Sample 1:

- 0.54
- 0.55
- 0.54
- 0.56
- 0.56
- 0.55
- 0.55

Sample 2:

- 1.2
- 1.27
- 1.24
- 1.24
- 1.25
- 1.22

# Stability related to cuvette

When we insert / remove the cuvette we observe the following values

- 197474
- 191596
- 190325
- 173893
- 190822
- 201730
- 202131
- 190058
- 205585
- 186595

What we observe is that the orientation of the cell is critical. If we force the rotation of the cell between parallel or distort we have the followings values:

- 229460
- 183143

Turning of 90Â° the cell as also big impact depending I guess the quality of the cuvette. In our case (with cheap plastic ones) we observe:

- 219035
- 259780
- 215050
- 263096
- 217012
- 249061
- 213230

# Hacking of the case

It appears that when measuring the difference of absorbance between an empty tank and a tank full of water, the values were aberrants. Indeed the energy was higher with the water than without. One of the problem could be that there is a space inside the tank hole that could lead to refraction. We designed a piece to hide this space using 3D printing.

We obtained theses results that differ from the one with the ones without the piece:
