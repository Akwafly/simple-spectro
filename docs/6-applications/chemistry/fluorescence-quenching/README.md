# Fluorescence quenching

In order to determine if the spectrophotometer is able to measure the difference of UV absorbance in a fluorescence quenching situation, we used fluorescein and potassium iodide (KI) as a quencher.

To do it, we started with a solution of KI 0.01M and diluted it to obtain 0.005M, 0.001M, 0.0005M, 0.0001M. Then from each solution we picked 3 drops and put them in a tank full of florescein.

Here are the results: 


#### KI 0.01M: 
|             | MEAN   | SD  |
|-------------|--------|-----|
|UV absorbance|0,44    |0,021|

#### KI 0.005M: 
|             | MEAN   | SD|
|-------------|--------|------|
|UV absorbance|   0,392| 0,019|

#### KI 0.001M: 
|             | MEAN   | SD   |
|-------------|--------|------|
|UV absorbance|0,232   | 0,022|

#### KI 0.0005M: 
|             | MEAN   | SD  |
|-------------|--------|-----|
|UV absorbance|  0,118 |0,018|

#### KI 0.0001M: 
|             | MEAN   | SD|
|-------------|--------|---|
|UV absorbance|        |   |
