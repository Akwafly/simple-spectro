# Patent blue V

To begin we did a very simple experiment that allows to measure the 
absorbance of solutions containing different known concentrations of
patent blue V (E131), a blue pigment that is used in various blue
candies.

The result is rather good knowing that the solutions were simply prepared by
adding various volumes (0 to 2 mL) of a concentrated solution with a 1mL seringe to 100mL of water. Not the more accurate method...
