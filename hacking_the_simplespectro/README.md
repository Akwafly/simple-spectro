**hacking_the_simplespectro** is a hacked version of the simple spectrophotometer (v. 1.6.0) so that it can be directly implemented in the bioreactor v.4 https://github.com/Bioreactor/Bioreactor_v4, allowing automatic measurement of absorbance. The folder contains the CAD files of the design of the spectro-plongeur (probe), the protocol and results of experiments and documentation (using and making).
